# The **Helix** :pipeline: supports icons now

This :tada: will render as an icon. :thumbsup:

This :#tada: will also render as an icon, but is part of an icon collection.

:: smile :smile::smile:::smile::::smile:

```javascript
console.log('this is in a :code: block');
```
`this is inline :code:`

:rocket: is an icon at the beginning of the line, and here's one at the end: :heart-0:

No icon here
