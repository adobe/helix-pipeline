If the `invalid` file validates (false positive), the schema is too lax and the overall build will fail. `invalid` files will not be merged into documentation.\n  - `*.description.md` is a description file that will be merged into the `\"description\"` field at the root of the schema, allowing the authoring of longer descriptions. The merge happens before publishing the schema file or creating a joint Markdown file\n  - `schemas/assets` – for schemas related to the asset core concept, including image, video, document\n  - `schemas/audiences` – for schemas describing audiences, segments, and groups of consumers\n  - `schemas/campaigns` – for schemas describing orchestrated experience campaign\n  - `schemas/content` – for schemas related to content, including visual, audible, and virtual reality content\n  - `schemas/context` – for schemas related to the context of a digital experience, including profile, person, environment\n  - `schemas/data` – for schemas describing collected data, metric, etc.\n  - `schemas/external/*` – for JSON Schema representation of externally defined standards\n  - `schemas/channels` – for schemas describing experience channels and locations therein\n  - `schemas/common` – for basic concepts like extensibility that are not covered in `external` schemas\n- `*.ttl`: legacy schema files in Turtle Syntax that have not yet been converted into JSON Schema\n- `package.json`: a build file for `npm` that allows the generation of Markdown from the JSON Schema source files and (later) the generation of an AEM package to be deployed on the Adobe I/O Website\n- `README.md`: this file\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: guidelines for contributors, covering process, conventions and design guidelines\n\n## Tooling\n\nThe tooling project (e.g. for generating Markdown documentation, example validation, JSON Schema documentation inlining) is located in the [adobe/jsonschema2md](https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md) git repository.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nYou need:\n\n1.  Node.js and `npm`\n2.  `curl`\n\n### Validation of local changes prior to creating any Pull Requests to adobe/xdm\n\nThis project contains a minimal validation script that depends on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com). You can use it to validate the JSON example files against the JSON Schema files after making changes to either.\n\nFrom the root directory of the local repository run:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ npm test\n\n> xdm@0.9.3 test /Users/fmeschbe/src/platform/xdm\n> mocha\n...\n\n$ npm run lint\n...\n```\n\nIf you see warnings or error messages (or an non-zero exit code), fix them before making a pull request.\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- see the [Contributor's guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### AEM Package Generation (optional)\n\nWith all dependencies installed, run the following commands from the root directory of the local repository:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ npm run package\n```\n\nThis will fetch all dependencies, then generate Markdown in the `docs/reference` directory and then generate an AEM package under `xdm-docs.zip`. The package can be uploaded using the command\n\n```bash\n$ npm run upload\n```\n\n`upload` will upload to the Adobe I/O Staging instance. To upload to production, use `upload:prod` instead.\n\nThe AEM password is not saved in this repository (of course), but you can set it using this command:\n\n```bash\n$ npm config set xdm-models:aem_password $AEM_PASSWORD\n```\n\nThis is assuming `$AEM_PASSWORD` has been provided to your Continuous Integration system or set on the command line beforehand.\n\nRunning `upload` will only make the documentation visible on the \"author\" instance, this means visitors to the site cannot see any of the documentation. To publish it, run the `npm run activate` or `npm run activate:prod` commands.\n\nA full process would then look like this:\n\n```bash\n$ npm config set xdm-models:aem_password $AEM_PASSWORD\n$ npm install\n$ npm test\n$ npm run package\n$ npm run upload\n$ npm run activate\n```\n\nThis will generate documentation, create an AEM package, install it on (stage) author, and activate it from there, so that visitors can read the documentation.\n\n#### A Note on Dependencies\n\nThe `package.json` script will fetch a released version of the AEM Markdown Importer JAR using curl.\n\n## Links\n\n### Specifications\n\n- [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)\n- [JSON-LD 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/)\n- [XMP SPECIFICATION PART 1 DATA MODEL, SERIALIZATION, AND CORE PROPERTIES](http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/xmp/pdfs/XMP%20SDK%20Release%20cc-2014-12/XMPSpecificationPart1.pdf)\n\n### Vocabularies/Ontologies\n\n- [schema.org](http://schema.org)\n- [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/)\n- [OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-overview-20091027/)\n- [SKOS Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/)\n\n## License/Copyright\n\nCopyright 2017 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
