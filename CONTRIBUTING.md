## Things to Keep in Mind

This project uses a **commit then review** process, which means that for approved maintainers, changes can be merged immediately, but will be reviewed by others.

For other contributors, a maintainer of the project has to approve the pull request.

# Before You Contribute

* Check that there is an existing issue in GitHub issues
* Check if there are other pull requests that might overlap or conflict with your intended contribution

# How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Make some changes on a branch on your fork
3. Create a pull request from your branch

In your pull request, outline:

* What the changes intend
* How they change the existing code
* If (and what) they breaks
* Start the pull request with the GitHub issue ID, e.g. #123

Lastly, please follow the [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when submitting a pull request!

Commit messages must respect [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/). You can use `npm run commit` which will guide you to create a commit message that respects the convention. If you know the convention, you can still use your favorite commit mechanism.

## Coding Styleguides

Project Helix uses the [AirBNB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), enforced through `npm lint`.

## Commit Message Format

This project uses a structured commit changelog format that should be used for every commit. Use `npm run commit` instead of your usual `git commit` to generate commit messages using a wizard.

```bash
# either add all changed files
$ git add -A
# or selectively add files
$ git add package.json
# then commit using the wizard
$ npm run commit
```

# How Contributions get Reviewed

One of the maintainers will look at the pull request within one week. Feedback on the pull request will be given in writing, in GitHub.

# Release Management

The project's committers will release to the [Adobe organization on npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/org/adobe).
Please contact the [Adobe Open Source Advisory Board](https://git.corp.adobe.com/OpenSourceAdvisoryBoard/discuss/issues) to get access to the npmjs organization.

The release process is fully automated using `semantic-release`, increasing the version numbers, etc. based on the contents of the commit messages found.
